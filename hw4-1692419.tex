\section{Introduction}

Diffie-Hellman is one of the early methods for the exchanging of cryptographic keys in a public network. It was developed in 1976 \cite{Diffie1976} and now is a public domain algorithm.
An interesting result of 2015 \cite{Adrian2015a} shows that practical implementations of this method must not be considered secure against state actors.

In this report, we present a possible approach for the generalization of Diffie-Hellman (DH) for multiple parties and a consideration about the security of such a method.

\section{Classic DH Overview}

Before starting with the n-parties approach, we present a survey of the classic DH method between two parties.

We have two parties, Alice and Bob, that wants to share a key through a not secure channel.

The algorithm is the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alice choose two numbers, $p$ and $g$. The first is a prime number, the second is the generator of the ciclyc multiplicative group $Z^*_p$, so every coprime of p can be expressed as a power of $g$ modulo $p$;
    \item Alice choose $a \in \{1, ..., p-1\}$ and compute $A = g^a$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Alice sends $A$, $p$ and $g$ to Bob;
    \item Bob choose $b \in \{1, ..., p-1\}$ and compute $B = g^b$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Bob sends $B$ to Alice;
    \item Now the two parts can compute a shared key $K = g^{ab}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Alice compute $K$ with $B^a$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Bob compute $K$ with $A^b$ $mod$ $p$;
\end{itemize}

The shared key $K$ can be further used in a communication based on a symmetric encryption like AES. 

\subsection{Security}

A DH key is considered secure due to the fact that it is not distinguishable from random bytes in polynomial time thanks to the fact that computing $x$ given $g^x$ ($g$ is a generator as said before) is almost as hard as the discrete logarithm problem \cite{discrete}.
Reversing such one-way function is possible only with a brute-force, so with a large $x$ this process is computationally infeasible. An attacker can get both the $A$ and $B$ keys of Alice and Bob but can't compute the shared key $K$.
However, DH is vulnerable to main in the middle. An attacker can impersonate Alice when communicating with Bob and vice-versa. In this case, the attacker is not computing the secret numbers of Alice and Bob but is generating two pairs of secrets for the two parties and performing DH (like a proxy). So, in the end, the attacker has two shared key, one for the communication with Alice and one for Bob.

\section{Three parties DH}

We start presenting multi-parties DH in a case with three parties and then we will expose a generalization for n-parties.

The parties are Alice, Bob, and Woody. In the selected approach, proposed in 2008 in \cite{Biswas}, one of the parties is a master that establish the key and then become a normal user. In our example the master is Alice.

The method proceeds in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alice choose two numbers, $p$ and $g$, as in classic DH.
    \item Alice choose $a \in \{1, ..., p-1\}$ and compute $A = g^a$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Alice sends $A$, $p$ and $g$ to Bob and Woody;
    \item Bob choose $b \in \{1, ..., p-1\}$ and compute $B = g^b$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Bob sends $B$ to Alice;
    \item Woody choose $c \in \{1, ..., p-1\}$ and compute $C = g^c$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Woody sends $C$ to Alice;
    \item Now two shared keys can be computet, $K_b = g^{ab}$ $mod$ $p$ and $K_c = g^{ac}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Alice compute both keys with $K_b = B^a$ $mod$ $p$ and $K_c = C^a$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Bob compute $K_b$ with $A^b$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Woody compute $K_c$ with $A^c$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Alice compute $D_c = g^{K_c}$ $mod$ $p$ and sends it to Bob;
    \item Alice compute $D_b = g^{K_b}$ $mod$ $p$ and sends it to Woody;
    \item Bob compute $K = (D_c)^{K_b}$ $mod$ $p = g^{K_b*K_c}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Woody compute $K = (D_b)^{K_c}$ $mod$ $p = g^{K_b*K_c}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Alice compute $K = g^{K_b*K_c}$ $mod$ $p$ directly;
    \item Now all parties share the key $K$ and Alice is not a master anymore.
\end{itemize}

The steps involving Bob and Woody can be in parallel. The master performs $n$ exponentiations so the overall performance is based on $P_i$. Thus, for a better implementation between machines is good to elect as master the machine with the highest computational power.

\section{Multi parties DH}

In this section we present the generalization of the previous exposed approach on $n$ parties, $P_i$ with $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$. In this case we select as master $P_i$ and the other parties, $P_j$ with $j \neq i$, are slaves.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $P_i$ choose two numbers, $p$ and $g$, as in classic DH.
    \item $P_i$ choose $x_i \in \{1, ..., p-1\}$ and compute $X_i = g^{x_i}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item $P_i$ sends $X_i$, $p$ and $g$ to the other parties $P_j$;
    \item Each $P_j$ choose an $x_j \in \{1, ..., p-1\}$ and compute $X_j = g^{x_j}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Each $P_j$ sends $X_j$ to $P_i$;
    \item Each $P_j$ generates a key $K_j = (X_i)^{x_j}$ $mod$ $p = g^{x_i*x_j}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item $P_i$ generates $n-1$ keys for each slave $P_j$, $K_j = (X_j)^{x_i}$ $mod$ $p = g^{x_i*x_j}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item $P_i$, for all slaves, combines all generated keys in $X_{k,j} = g^{\Pi K_{k \neq j} }$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item $P_i$, for all slaves, sends $X_{k,j}$ to the correspondent $P_j$;
    \item Each $P_j$ compute the final key $K = (X_{k,j})^{K_j}$ $mod$ $p = g^{K_1,...,K_n}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item $P_i$ compute directly the final key $K = g^{K_1,...,K_n}$ $mod$ $p$;
    \item Now all parties share the key $K$ and $P_i$ is not a master anymore.
\end{itemize}

The method is synchronous for $P_i$ and $P_j$ ($j \neq i$) but all the $P_j$ parties work asynchronously and do not need to know the number of the parties.

\section{Security considerations}

The proposed multi-parties method final key, $K$, is not distinguishable in polynomial time from random numbers. This is true because the generation of the public keys in the first stage, $X_i$ $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$, follows the standard DH protocol and the generation fo $K$ follows an equivalent procedure of DH because it is an exponentiation of a product of secret values instead of a single secret value.
So an attker that observe the network cannot retrieve any provate key.

On the other hand, as standard DH, this method is vulnerable to man in the middle.
If an attacker compromise one of the parties he can compute the final key and so compromise the entire communication. 
Does not matter if the attacker compromise the master or one of the slaves, at the end all parties have the key.

This weakness is a trade off with the advantages of having a single final key for all parties.

The presented method is a good method if we can ensure that man in the middle is not possible in the channel in wich we are using the protocol.
